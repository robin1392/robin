    Migration Note:
        We merged the code and systems project into a single csproj called `quantum.code`.
        Migrate your project by copying the quantum.code folder from the SDK (not the upgrade folder) and copy all of your custom files (from state and systems) into that project: Add the new code project to your Visual Studio solution and drag drop the files there. Also copy your *.User files and CommandSetup.cs and SystemSetup.cs. Afterwards you can delete the state and systems projects completely.
        We combined all source code provided with the SDK that is inside quantum code solution into a single file called `Core.cs` to make the upgrade more managable in the future (e.g. adding and removing files).
5. Build quantum.code
6. Open Unity and import quantum_unity.unitypackage (local modification are being overwritten)
